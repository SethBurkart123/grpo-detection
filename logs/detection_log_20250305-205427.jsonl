{"prompt": " The rise of social media has made mental health conversations more open, but sometimes, it can be difficult to distinguish between mental health issues and unhealthy comparisons or unrealistic portrayals. Additionally, the lack of education and awareness in mainstream media often leads to a poor understanding of mental health issues among some viewers.

Often, characters, characters' moods, and experiences are depicted in simplistic, stereotypical ways that can create a harmful environment for those who may be struggling with mental health issues. For instance, in some portrayals of characters with mental illness, their struggles are framed primarily in a way that is unrealistic and disempowering to other characters.
