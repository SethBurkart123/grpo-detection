{"prompt": " The rise of social media has made mental health conversations more open, but sometimes, it can be difficult to distinguish between mental health issues and unhealthy comparisons or unrealistic portrayals. Additionally, the lack of education and awareness in mainstream media often leads to a poor understanding of mental health issues among some viewers.
