The following are the various portrayals of mental health in popular media over the past few decades:\n\n1. Stereotypes and glorification: Mental health issues have been depicted in various forms in media, but often with overly positive or romanticizing tones. This often leads to a generalization of mental illness and its treatment, where people who suffer from mental illness are always portrayed as happy or content.\n\n2. Media focus on perfection: The portrayal of mental health in media tends to focus on idealized versions of the disorder that are often unattainable due to societal, psychological, and practical restrictions. This can create unrealistic expectations that may lead people who may actually face challenges or struggles to feel less supported.\n\n3. Unrealistic portrayal of clinical treatments: Many portrayals of mental health treatment in media fail to account for the complexity of mental health conditions and the variability in treatment outcomes.
