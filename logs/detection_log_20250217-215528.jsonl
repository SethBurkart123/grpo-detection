{"prompt": " The unreliable narrator is a narrative technique in literature where the narrator of the story is not trustworthy or honest about the events that are being described. The narrator may have a particular bias or may not be telling the truth, creating a sense of uncertainty and distrust towards the reader. \n\nThis technique is often used to create suspense and intrigue in a story, as the reader must question the narrator's credibility and try to piece together the truth. This can be achieved through the use of unreliable tone and language, conflicting information within the text, and narrative gaps that hint at the narrator's untrustworthiness.\n\nReliable or trustworthy narrators tend to be more common in literature, where they aim to inform and educate the reader.

The reader becomes a co-creator of the narrative, interpreting and filling in the gaps created by the unreliable narrator.\n\nExamples of unreliable narrators can be found in various genres, including mystery, horror, and thrillers. Some famous examples are found in Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None,\" Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" and William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury.\"\n\nThe unreliable narrator", "scores": {"scoreGptZero": 50, "scoreOpenAI": 0, "scoreWriter": 50, "scoreCrossPlag": 0, "scoreCopyLeaks": 100, "scoreSapling": 50, "scoreContentAtScale": 50, "scoreZeroGPT": 100, "human": 100}, "average_score": 0.5555555555555556}
